        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>One of the most popular rum cocktails served today, with a recipe known around the world.
            The origins of this classic drink are traced to Cuba, it was composed of aguardiente, lime, mint and sugar.
            Eventually, the rum replaced the aguardiente and the previous name (EL Drake, named after Francis Drake) was replaced with 'Mojito'.
            Some say that it was used for medicinal purposes (we can imagine why), but it rapidly became one of the most famous Latin drinks around the world.
            The mojito is a more laborious drink, since it involves muddling the mint, but it's an awesome choice for a summer refreshment.</p>
