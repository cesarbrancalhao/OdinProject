                <h3>Description:</h3>
                <p>One of the most popular rum cocktails served today, with a recipe know around the world.
                    The origins of this classic drink are traced to Cuba, it was composed of aguardiente, lime, mint and surgar.
                    Eventually, the rum replaced the aguardiente and the previous name (EL Drake, named after Francis Drake) was replaced with 'Mojito'.
                    Some says that it was used for medicinal purpouses (we can imagine why), but it rapidly became one of the most famous latin drinks around the world.
                    The mojito is a more laborous drink, since it involves muddling the mint, but its an awesome choice for a summer refreshment.</p>
